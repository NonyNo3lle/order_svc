== ORDER_SVC

=== Purpose

Order Red Hat CloudForms (or ManageIQ) services in bulk via the API.  You must provide a catalog name and catalog item (in text format).

If you do not provide a user name, you will be prompted for one.  

Total requests specifies the amount of services you wish to order in total.

Group count allows you to break up the orders into groups equaling the number of services specified.

Group wait will pause ordering between groups.

Api wait specifies a quick pause between API calls in the same group.

Uri is the URI of your CloudForms/ManageIQ appliance.
